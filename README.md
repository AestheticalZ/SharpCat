# SharpCat
A C# library (still unfinished) to get images from the Cat and Dog API.

Very simple to use, just get a key from the respective API website, create a new SharpCatRequester/SharpDogRequester object with it, then create a List<> of CatImage/DogImage and await GetImageAsync (and also create a search params object). Simple, right?
